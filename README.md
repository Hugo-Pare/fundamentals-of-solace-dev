# Solace Chat Application - Developer Exercise 4

In this section, we are introducing an Authorization Server that handles auth requests from the UI.

An Authorization Server will be introduced under the auth-server folder. In addition, a solace-chat-common module has been added which will contain common objects for both the web-app-server and the auth-server.

To install the solace-chat-common module, run the following commands:

```
cd solace-chat-common
mvn install
```
