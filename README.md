# Solace Chat Application
The Fundamentals of Solace Development online learning course introduces developers to Solace messaging. The course provides an overview of the various Open Protocols and languages Solace supports, and the concepts behind messaging with Solace. Topics covered include connecting your application to Solace, multi-protocol support, message exchange patterns, and how they relate to applications. Finally, we will create an application that utilizes Solace PubSub+ to learn how to publish and receive both direct and guaranteed messages.

The course can be viewed on Udemy at https://www.udemy.com/fundamentals-of-solace-development/.
